        <p><h2>About Me</h2></p>

        <p>A jack of all trades, who loves to figure things out.
          Seeking mastery over whatever thing I’m working on is what drives me.
          My love of computing started at an early age, when I learned to use our
          family's Amiga computer, and I have always been curious to learn more and
          I’m excited to watch technology develop, and see what problems technology
          can solve in the future. I am currently eager to expand my knowledge of DevOps,
          Scalability, and Security.
