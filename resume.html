          <hr>
          <p>A jack of all trades, who loves to figure things out.
            Seeking mastery over whatever I’m working on is what drives me.
            My love of computing started at an early age.
            I’m excited to watch technology develop, and see what problems technology
            can solve in the future. I am currently eager to expand my knowledge of DevOps,
            Scalability, and Security.
